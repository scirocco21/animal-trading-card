			<p class="description">Hedgehogs get their name from their foraging habits: at night, they rummage through undergrowth and gardens in search of small critters.  They hibernate in winter and need to be well fed to survive; hoglets born in late summer or autumn may appreciate a little help with fattening up.</p>
